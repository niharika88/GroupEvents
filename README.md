# GroupEvents
A simple api to implement group events which can be published / drafted as per the user input , also events can be scheduled as well.

# Problem Statement
A group event will be created by an user.
The group event should run for a whole number of days e.g.. 30 or 60. 
There should be attributes to set and update the start, end or duration of the event (and calculate the other value).
The event also has a name, description (which supports formatting) and location. The event should be draft or published. 
To publish all of the fields are required, it can be saved with only a subset of fields before itâ€™s published.
When the event is deleted/remove it should be kept in the database and marked as such
